# Personal website

Previous source code for my personal website. This project was made using plain HTML and CSS. No framework was used, and the deployment consisted of merely serving the files in the `/src` directory.

## Motivation to archive this repository

As part of adding a personal blog, I decided to use a static site generator and migrate my website, which now lives in a new repo.
